This app is essentially a psuedo-Amazon.com.  It is meant to show the user a table, have them pick and item (by id) from the table, have them order a quantity of their choosing, and update the database that the table is connected to.  There were 3 npm's of note used in this app. 1. mysql (for the database) 2. inquirer (to take in user-entered data) 3. cli-table2 (to make a user friendly table).  cli-table2 seemed to work the best for me.  I did have a lot of trouble making it work, initally.  So, I'll end this readme with some advice;  ALWAYS LOOK AT THE SYNTAX OF YOUR NPM'S!
